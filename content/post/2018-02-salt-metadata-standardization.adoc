Sum up all features on salt-formulas project.


### side note

I also find important to share metadata structure cross tools, so transition is possible and approach
is similar. Assume it as PEP8 or FoodCritic for your metadata. Assume it as documented API.

With this motivation it would be greate set-up an upstream repo for "shared metadata" project with tools
for it's visualization, validation, schema checks an description of it's attributes.
