As my Django site from 2006 or so went recently south I decided to to make it up from scratch.

{{< figure src="/img/post/2015-12_old-apealive-net.png" title="Original apealive.net website" >}}

Even though I am now pretty solid in DevOps, applying it on low frequency used blog and keeping django running for years it's overhead. I will rather spend that one with my kids. Sorry loved #django #python ;-(.

On the other hand, during the time, I wrote few pages using static generators and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is the latest one I kept an eye on. So why not give it a chance...
