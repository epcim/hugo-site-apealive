# Docker Swarm

I have been working closely with TCP Cloud in my spare time during past weeks to evaluate Docker Swarm cluster orchestration. Kind of easy
level to get some insight into the product and it's bugs ;). Yeah.. it's not production ready yet!

Anyway I am going to deliver a sweet talk and open discussion at today's Docker Meetup (Prague). For these who may concern
the presentation is online already. (http://slides.com/petrmichalec/docker-swarm)
