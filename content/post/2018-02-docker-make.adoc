[.lead]
Dockerfile is nice, but itâ€™s a puppet toy when it comes to scale. I am looking for
a solution to consistently build many docker images with shared layers and consistent and predictable build workflow.

<!--more-->

== TL;DR
My use-case is simple. I want to build matrix of docker images for kitchen-salt CI, containerized
Salt-Master and bare-bone OS boilerplates. With Salt, salt formulas installed or without it at all.
That makes more than 60 image versions.

My matrix looks like:

[source, YAML]
.invoke.yaml
----
matrix:
  dist:
    ubuntu:
    - trusty
    - xenial
    - bionic
    debian:
    - stretch
    centos:
    - 7
  salt:
    - stable
    - stable 2016.3
    - stable 2017.7
    - develop
  salt-formulas:
    - stable
    - nightly
----

== Tools evaluated

I did a simple search and found couple of tools that made me interested

* https://github.com/avirshup/DockerMake[DockerMake] (winner)
* https://cloud.google.com/container-builder/docs[google builder]
* https://github.com/grammarly/rocker[Rocker]
* https://github.com/mvanholsteijn/docker-makefile[docker-makefile]
* https://windsock.io/automated-docker-image-builds-with-multiple-tags/
* https://objectpartners.com/2017/09/20/docker-parameterized-builds-using-git-tags-part-1-of-2/
* RedHat build tools

== DockerMake

I choosed https://github.com/avirshup/DockerMake[DockerMake] as it is:

- lite
- flexible enough
- logic/isolated/layers
- active in development

How it works you may find out from the following snippet.

[source, YAML]
.DockerMake.yaml
----
    [first_image_name]:
      FROM: [named_base_image]
      build: |
        RUN [something]
        ADD [something else]
        [Dockerfile commands go here]
    [another_image_name]:
     requires:
       - [first_image_name]
     build: |
       [additional Dockerfile instructions]
----

For all features check `avirshup` repo or my final implementation for
https://github.com/epcim/docker-salt-formulas/blob/master/DockerMake.yml[docker-salt-formulas].


== Extend with "makefile" with PyInvoke

DockerMake is worth to indepotently declare individual layers. However if used standalone bit fails
to use key/args in layer, image, variable names.

To solve the issue I wrote simple "makefile" specification with https://github.com/pyinvoke/invoke[PyInvoke].

[]
----
    tasks.py     # Script to write tasks for pyinvoke
    invoke.yaml  # Configuration file (optional)
----

Finally to build images or list individual targets I run these options:

[source, BASH]
.usage.sh
----
    inv --list
    inv all --dry
    inv all --dry-targets

    # build whole matrix
    inv all --push
    inv all --push -w    # warnings only: to survive on errors

    # individual targets
    # invoke [target] [--[args][=value]] [--push]
    invoke all --dry-targets --filter "{'target':'saltstack', 'salt': 'stable'}"
    invoke build wheelhouse --require "salt salt-formulas wheel" \
      --dist=debian --dist-rel=stretch \
      --salt=develop --formula-rev=nightly \
      --push
----

Good enough?
