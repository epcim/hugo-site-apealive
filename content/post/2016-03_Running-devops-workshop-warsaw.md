# DevOps workshop with Chef

At the end of the 2015 I was asked by IBM colleague from Poland who is leading a team of Java developers to develop and
deliver a DevOps workshop.

I took a challenge and delivered March 9-10 in Warsaw personally. The slides from the event are available at: http://slides.com/petrmichalec/devops-workshop

## Agenda

At first quite challenge as the DevOps topic is so wide, right? Finally I narrowed agenda to some "devops" discussion, Chef.io
and Docker including extensive labs.

The topics included:

* DevOps Definitions
* Chef DevOps Kung-fu
* Chef introduction
* Toolbox
* Chef workflow 
* Chef Delivery, Analytics
* TTD, Compliance
* CI/CD
* Labs
  * Chef Lab I., II., III.
  * Docker Labs I, II.
  * ELK, GRAFANA, Drone.io

## Lessons learned

I got quite positive feedback after all. Anyway the most frequent complains were "too much tools to start with", "chef labs needs more time".
And yes all that's true. It's a tough workshop. Next time I will reschedule for more days anyway.

Actually I found DEVs and OPS people that their the level of "linux" skills to operate CLI and editors, git and around tooling at a level of zero from my "uff" terminal guy perspective.
That brings the questions to my mind what to start fist. Editors and shell of choice?

# Outcome

I have split the workshop in two. Another change I will do is to split participants to teams and init cooperation during labs over slack etc.
If you are interested I would be pleased to deliver:

* 1-day docker workshop (intermediate)
* 2-day chef training (intermediate)
